Finally, Allah has made it possible for me to partcipate in this calendar design competition without using the Adobe Illustrator😭, though they demanded on .ai files. 
I completely designed using the Inkscape app and it took about four whole days to just design these two!! However, these are my faourite as they have taught me the lesson
"Don't say YES to everybody, sometimes one NO can bring hundred times larger benefit to you."
Ta Ta👋.
